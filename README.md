# Advanced-Regression-Modeling-for-Ecommerce-Spending
This project predicts yearly customer spending on an ecommerce platform using features like session length, app and website usage, and membership duration. It applies Linear, Ridge, Lasso, and Polynomial Regression models with preprocessing and evaluation. Visualizations and error analysis help assess and improve model performance for accurate predictions.
